          Photographer Analissa Longoria&apos;s work is imbued with a certain
          subterranean elegance, reflecting the very essence of her own bohemian
          spirit. With an ocean full of empathy and a keenly compassionate eye,
          Analissa&apos;s portfolio is a veritable melting pot of converging worlds.
          Based in East Vancouver, Analissa is a champion of the underclass, the
          marginalized, the disenfranchised, the mad and the disaffected, while
          also a supporter of some of Vancouver&apos;s most glamorous socialites and
          models, shooting from her own portrait studio in Chinatown.

          As Oscar Wilde said; &quot;We are all in the gutter but some of us are
          looking at the stars&quot;... It is in how she integrates gritty realism with
          a velvet nostalgic beauty that this expression is summoned to mind.
          Analissa visually conveys a marrying of her childhood obsession with
          fashion magazines with her upbringing on the gritty streets of East
          Vancouver.

          Delicately capturing the emotional depth of her subjects, a
          broken-beauty is ever present across a broad range of styles, from
          environmental candid black and white low-light work, to futuristic and
          hallucinatory neon dreamlike candour, Analissa shoots her subjects in
          a range of environments - from their own intimate habitats, on the
          streets, at hedonistic underground DIY gatherings and art shows. From
          her studio space in Chinatown, she can explore her subjects in a more
          controlled setting, here she draws upon influences such as Helmut
          Newton, Peter Lindbergh, Mario Testino, Annie Leibowitz, Nan Goldin,
          Steven Meisel and many other of New York&apos;s famous photographers of
          that time shooting the iconic original supermodels of the 90s.

          Autodidactic and intuitive, the work has a visceral punk rock quality.
          Her disarming presence allowing her the intimacy with her subjects
          that others would surely be denied. This trust is repaid with a love
          and admiration that is unmistakably shining through in the images.

          &quot;The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to
          live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same
          time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn,
          burn, burn, like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders
          across the stars and in the middle you see the blue centerlight pop
          and everybody goes &apos;Awww!&apos;&quot; - Jack Kerouac

          Growing up in the Bohemian melting pot neighbourhood East Vancouver,
          in a modern metropolitan city, I have been forever immersed with the
          fringe and the cutting edge, artists, free thinkers, and avant-garde
          individuals. Witnessing future trends unfold on the streets years
          before they hit celebrity culture has been a constant source of
          inspiration for me. I find great fascination in observing contemporary
          artists, socialites and musicians, revisiting past times while
          evolving into future icons, creating a seamless blend of the past and
          the future is what I strive to express in my work. Drawing from an
          array of eras, I infuse my art with my nostalgia for the reckless
          angst of early 90s Grunge, the electronic romance of 80s new wave and
          post-punk, the raw and gritty rebellion of the late 70s no wave and
          punk scene, the psychedelic freedom of the late 60&apos;s, the soft
          femininity of the late 50&apos;s French New Wave Films, the glitz and
          decadence of the 20s, and the glittery raves of the early 2000s...

          Through the years, Analissa has always been a steady inspirational
          entity and light within the &apos;weirdo&apos; underbelly of the Vancouver
          scene. Her attention to detail when it comes to fashion transcends
          this era so effortlessly... She simply was not made for this time.
          Every experience I have had professionally and personally with her
          seems as though time stops and we are left dreaming about what beauty
          can be created between us. It&apos;s so much more about creating a
          revolution in that moment than the actual photos being taken...
          Here&apos;s to Analissa making Vancouver an even more special place with
          her rock and roll heart of gold and a soul this city so desperately
          requires.

          &quot;Analissa moves apparition-like among scenes which immediately become
          alluring under her artist&apos;s gaze. The curtain is pulled back on
          underground nightlife, made into touching, raw humanity with her lens.
          Individuals and musicians become iconic in her portraiture, colours
          more saturated, glittering fever dreams more possible. She captures
          strength where it stands tall, softness where it needs a place to
          rest.&quot;
